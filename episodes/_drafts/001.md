title: Cloud
---

Mark tries to send Casey a calendar invitation and falls in a gap between
clouds. Casey and Mark both switch to Fastmail, for reasons. Casey is skeeved
by Google Plus encroaching on his inbox. Mark thinks inboxes aren't private
spaces anymore. Casey broke his VPS and that is why "private clouds" are
nightmares. Mark ruminates on why implementing sync has flummoxed so many
good developers.
