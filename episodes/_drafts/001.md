Mark tries to send Casey a calendar invitation and falls in a gap between
clouds. Casey and Mark both switch to the same email provider for reasons.
Casey is skeeved by Google Plus encroaching on his inbox. Mark thinks inboxes
aren't private spaces anymore. Casey broke his VPS and that is why "private
clouds" are nightmares. Mark ruminates on why implementing sync has flummoxed
so many good developers.
