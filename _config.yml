  Abstract Factory is a podcast about technology, creativity, and society and
  the space where the three combineâ€”and sometimes conflict. What happens
  to identity, community, and self-expression when the internet becomes our
  world? Hosts @markwunsch and @ckolderup try to untangle what's happening in
  the hearts and minds of those who spend their lives in front of screens all day.
